## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/tomasgrusz/personal-web/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/tomasgrusz/personal-web/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide browser or platform information (Safari, Chrome, iOS, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/tomasgrusz/personal-web/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Console error message if applicable
  - OS, Browser and Version (Safari, Chrome, iOS, Windows, etc)
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to grusztomas0@gmail.com.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

The project uses GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/tomasgrusz/personal-web/issues/new)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help me understand your suggestion.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tomasgrusz/personal-web/issues).

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
